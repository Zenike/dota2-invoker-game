## Rules 			

- first step: configure yours keys ! (top menu)
- press start to launch the game
- activate the highlighted skill and press the ULTI button to show it
- use your skill 4 or 5 to activate a memorized skill
- launch the skill on the blue target (mouseleft)
- ghost walk and forge spirit will instacast without click (like ingame)
- you have the possibility to double tap alacrity

- A mistake will break your combo and take one of your 5 lifes away
- be advised that you can't reinvoke a spell already in your set. If you do, you will lose a life. Instead, use them directly with key 4 or key 5 without reinvoking

## I don't know the spells already...

No problem, just activate the "Tips" option on the top of the screen. That will show you the elements used in each spell.

## But i prefer quickcast !

I got you, a quickcast option exist in the top menu. Once activated, the keys 4 and 5 immediatly trigger the spell. No more mouse click needed !
